- **bl-art** is a blockchain solution for the industry of Art and luxury goods. 
It offers a secure and transparent platform for tracking art items and products,
insure quality and combat fraud.<br>

unique token. Instead of dealing with cryptocurrency we are dealing with 
crypto-collectibles. Tokens are based on the **ERC-721** standard which specifies 
a class of unique tokens.
